# Darktide Launcher

Use `scripts/launch-game.ps1` with Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7.

## Locate The Game

The Darktide game directory is the only installation-specific input.

1. Identify the user's Darktide game directory from the request or available context.
2. From that directory, use `<game>/binaries/Darktide.exe` with `<game>/binaries` as the working directory.
3. Verify that `Darktide.exe` exists at the derived path before launching it.
4. If the game directory is not known, ask the user for it. Do not scan entire drives.

`Status`, `Hide`, and `Show` do not need the game directory.

## Commands

From this skill's directory:

```powershell
& .\scripts\launch-game.ps1 Status
& .\scripts\launch-game.ps1 Start -GameRoot '<game>'
& .\scripts\launch-game.ps1 Start -GameRoot '<game>' -Hidden
& .\scripts\launch-game.ps1 Hide
& .\scripts\launch-game.ps1 Show
```

`Start` is the default action. Use `Start -Hidden` for hidden or unattended launches.

`Start` requires `-GameRoot` and identifies running instances by the full executable path. If that installation is already running, it returns its PIDs without changing those processes. Other installations do not block the launch: use a separate `Start -GameRoot` command for each installation. A new launch writes `steam_appid.txt` and uses the bundled launch arguments.

`Start -ValidateOnly -GameRoot '<game>'` checks prerequisites and reports the running process count for that installation without writing files or launching the game.

`Hide` and `Show` change an existing window without launching a process or writing files. A single running process is selected automatically. For multiple processes, pass `-ProcessId` using the target identified from context; otherwise list them with `Status` and ask the user to choose. No running game or an invalid PID is an error. `Show` restores minimized windows.

Window operations wait up to 120 seconds for the main window (`-WindowTimeoutSeconds` overrides this), confirm the requested visibility, and return. They do not monitor the session. Errors leave any surviving game process running.

## Results

- `NOT_RUNNING` or `RUNNING`: process status; `RUNNING` includes PID and executable path.
- `STARTED`: the process was created, but game loading is not confirmed.
- `HIDDEN` or `SHOWN`: the requested window state was confirmed.
